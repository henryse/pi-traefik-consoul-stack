# Traefik Consul Stack

This is a simple stack that can be used in a micro service stack.
 
There is also a non-Raspberry PI version of this called henryse/traefik-consul-stack.

To launch the stack simply do the following:

        bash ./launch-stack.sh
        
To stop the stack you can use:

        bash ./stop-service.sh
